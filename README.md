# Up-Down Tester

This program is meant to be run by systems that lie within a person VPN or Intranet and to verify whether systems that should be available or operational are indeed so.

Since I run a lot of VPN-only services myself and a few small websites for friends, I wanted a one-click-style solution I could use to validate whether things were working or if I needed to start running off to fix things.

*WIll insert usage instructions here*


This code is part of my effort to better myself in Golang and coding in general, as well as Git management.
